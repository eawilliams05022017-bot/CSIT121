            <h3>What is the URL?</h3>
            <p>The URL is: <a href= "https://corp.roblox.com/" target="_blank">corp.roblox.com</a></p>

        <section>
            <h3>What is the name of the website?</h3>
            <p>The name of the website is: Roblox </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Who is the site's target audience?</h3>
            <p>While the actual platform itself is targeted towards people who are interested in video games
             (primarily young children) This page is there business page,
              targeted towards investors and businesses looking to work with Roblox or form a partnership. </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>How is the site organized?</h3>
            <p>When you load up the website you will see a navigation bar and under it,
                 you will see the words: One platform, millions of ways to engage. A phrase to help showcase the possibilites of roblox. 
                 One the navigation bar, there are things you can click on to give more information 
                 on Roblox like company information, safety features you can enable, and how to contact them for partnerships. </p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h3>Which CRAP Design principle does the website use?</h3>
            <p>For repetition, I noticed how it has the same color scheme mostly being black and gray, 
               to give off a serious and professional tone since this is there business page. For alignment, 
               most of the things on the page are in order and lined up correctly, to make it seem more polished.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>What is the audit score according to the accessibility checker?</h3>
            <p>The score for the page is 47%, which isnt a good score. the checker says the website has many problems some of them being labled 
                 as crititcal problems such
                 as parent and child elements clashing and some of the headings not having discernible text. It is clear that the website
                has a lot to improve on in order to get there score up. </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>How effective is the site and does it support users in completing actions?</h3>
            <p>The site does look easy to use from first glance. 
                A potential problem that someone could run into is finding the certain subject they were trying to look for
                since the navigation hub could be seen as confusing to someone. Plus when you click on something in the 
            navigation bar, there really isnt an indicator that the page changed.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>How is efficient is the site and can users perform task quickly?</h3>
            <p>The website works really efficiently, the things load pretty fast when clicked on the load time is pretty much non existent.
                This will make it so people dont have to wait forever to access the material and close the page. It also
                doesnt open new tabs when clicked on things in the navigation bar so you dont have to worry about multiple
                tabs being open to access the materials.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>How engaging is the topic, is it pleasant to use and appropriate for its industry?</h3>
            <p>Its a mixed bag when it comes to this question, 
                while the website does point out the achievements and feats Roblox has done, 
                it really capture the true experience of Roblox and often makes it feel emotionless. 
                While it makes sense for them to keep there professionalism, it seems like they are doing the bare minimum 
                to grasp your intrest.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>How can the website improve?</h3>
            <p>I feel like the website could be less repetition cause it seems that out of the four principles, 
            it follows repetition the most. maybe add more contrasting colors to make it more lively and pleasing to look at. There should be a 
           balance when applying the four principle, to make the website more enjoyable, and not come off as lazy or feel like a
           waste of time creating. </p>
