            <p>At Pixel Forge, we believe video games are more than just brightly colored time wasters designed to make your hard drive cry. 
                Sure, the world is overflowing with “modern classics” that insist the peak of digital entertainment is running in circles,
                 opening loot boxes, or rage-quitting for the fifth time in an hour. But we think games can be more, much more. 
                 We see video games as imaginative, beautifully chaotic art. The kind that actually means something. 
                 The kind that makes you laugh, think, or question your life choices 
                 (in a good way, not in a “why did I buy that battle pass?” way). 
                 So while some games focus on fast reactions, loud explosions, or endless grinding, 
                 we’re here forging something different. 
                 We want to create experiences with heart, creativity, 
                 and purpose games that make you feel something besides the urge to uninstall. 
                 At Pixel Forge, our mission is simple Remind the world that video games can be meaningful, magical, 
                 and maybe even a little profound… while still being ridiculously fun. After all, 
                 art doesn’t have to hang in a museum it can explode, jump, dance, glitch, and respawn too.</p>
